If you want to extend Demobox, there are two main avenues you can take.

# Themes

You can check out other examples to get inspiration. Themes are developed
using React and RCSS, and *everything is javascript*. It actually works super
well.

# Plugins

Plugins can do a number of things, including:

- create "derived pages" -- pages that summerize or otherwise are based off of
  other pages. An "index" or "blog summary" page is an example of such a page.
- reorganize / modify / remove pages
